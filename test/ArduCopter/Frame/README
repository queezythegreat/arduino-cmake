If you are looking frame design files, please go to my branch and you can
find them from there.

Files will be placed in here after they are rock solid and in full production
till then they might change often and we don't want to distribute them as
official files to avoid confusion between official and under work files.

Unofficial under work files can be found from address:

Best regards,
