  I2C.h - I2C library
  Copyright (c) 2011 Wayne Truchsess.  All right reserved.
  Rev 2.0 - September 19th, 2011
          - Added support for timeout function to prevent
            and recover from bus lockup (thanks to PaulS
            and CrossRoads on the Arduino forum)
          - Changed return type for stop() from void to
            uint8_t to handle timeOut function
  Rev 1.0 - August 8th, 2011

  This is a modified version of the Arduino Wire/TWI
  library.  Functions were rewritten to provide more functionality
  and also the use of Repeated Start.  Some I2C devices will not
  function correctly without the use of a Repeated Start.  The
  initial version of this library only supports the Master.
